-----BUG-----
No mag exploits
	Player can exploit it by dropping the mag in the attachment menu, then
reloading the gun


-----ERRORS-----
Error on player disconnect (io violation when saving player data). Seems like the error made by the API, (look at /Error_Logs/ERROR_1.txt) as of now, the plugin didn't use openmod.users.yaml file. There's a possibility that this caused by creating UnturnedUserProvider object



-----DONE-----
Setting player level to zero or max not actually to that level [DONE]
Error when punching with bare hands [DONE]
