---- New Features ----
- Autosave feature
// excess exp and random boost

--- New Commands for Players ---

--- New Commands for Admins ---

---- Updates ----
- All command code rewrite, commands can now add or omit usernames or IDs.
- Command with prefix Player- no longer available.
///- Commands that edit player's skills, will be prompted if only supplied with only specialty (offense, defense, support), as it will edit the entirety of specialty's skills.
- Command that edits all skill in a specialty (offense, etc.) will be asked if want to continue. Some commands will use this as well.
- Major file handling code rewrite.
- Some events handling code rewrite.
- Parts of skill mechanic rewrite.
- Player will know if their skill has been edited or not
- Searching (in commands) specialty or skill name will use confidence search (will benefit players if they need a short name of it), similar algorithm used in OpenMod's username searching.
- Better reload spamming prevention.
	Spamming prevention method can be;
	- The spamming can be ignored
	- Spamming can be limited. (How many ammo loaded to a gun per n-minutes)
	- Same as no. 2, but the closer to the limit, the less exp they got until the cooldown resets (per n-minutes).
	- The cooldown doesn't have to be resetted, cooldown can adapt (maximum spamming can be extended, if wait long enough).
			For example: Maximum Rounds per 5 minutes, 200. If reloading for 50 rounds, then the player can spam it for 150 more. Then, if the player wait for a minute, then the player can spam it for 190 more.
- All online players will be notified when the plugin breaks at the startup, or the config has trouble loading.
- If reading config gives not fatal errors, it will only sent to server logs, not disabling usability (the plugin will still function after error).
- Plugin will tell player if they leveled up.

---- Bugs ----
- When reloading plugin or user connecting or respawning, if their hunger and thirst are in certain threshold, it will not start a timer to take account.
- More refined config checking.
- OnDied level reducing for type 'mult' reduce twice by multiply it again.
- OnDied level reducing for type 'base' only reduce 1 level, not based on the config.
- When died, skill level still reduced by the game, not by the plugin.
